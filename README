Pachi is two things: a simple modular framework for robots playing
the game of Go/Weiqi/Baduk, and a reasonably strong engine built
within this framework.


Engine
------

By default, Pachi currently uses the UCT engine that combines
monte-carlo approach with tree search; UCB1AMAF tree policy using
the RAVE method is used for tree search, while the Moggy playout
policy using 3x3 patterns and various tactical checks is used for
the random Monte-Carlo playouts.

The default engine plays by Chinese rules and should be about
2d KGS strength on 9x9. On 19x19, it might be about KGS 4k. Of couse,
this assumes reasonable hardware, e.g. four-threaded Core2 machine.

At the same time, various other approaches and tricks are being tried
and minor improvements have been achieved; they are enabled when they
give an universal playing strength boosts.


Except UCT, Pachi supports a simple idiotbot-like engine and an example
treeless MonteCarlo-player. The MonteCarlo simulation ("playout")
policies are also pluggable, by default we use one that makes use of
heavy domain knowledge.

Two special engines are also provided for development support:
* a simple "replay" engine that will simply play moves according
  to the playout policy suggestions
* a special "patternscan" engine that will respond to 'play' commands
  by iteratively matching various pattern features on each move and
  outputting them as response to the command; it is intended to be
  used for pattern-learning from games in cooperation with an external
  helper; no 'genmove' command support is provided


Framework
---------

The aim of the framework is to make it easy to plug your engine
to the common infrastructure and implement your ideas while
minimalizing the overhead of implementing the GTP, speed-optimized
board tools, etc.  Also, there are premade random playout and UCT
tree engines, so that you can directly tweak only particular policies.
The infrastructure is pretty fast and it should be quite easy
to extend it to provide more facilities for your engine (but it should
be at the same time kept as simple as possible).


Licence
-------

Pachi is under the MIT licence (almost public domain) so that as
many people as possible can use it; if you use it to create your engine,
appropriate credits would be appreciated. Some of the bundled engines
or policies are under a more restrictive licence (GPL).


To build Pachi, simply type:

	make

Built zzgo binary (named that way from historical reasons) in the current
directory is a GTP client; use your favorite Go client to connect to it
(generally it should be possible to use it in place of GNU Go; the
command-line usage is however different), or use kgsGtp to connect to KGS;
DO NOT make it accessible directly to enemy users since the parser is
not secure - see the HACKING file for details.

The zzgo binary can take many parameters, as well as the particular
engine being used; the defaults should be fine for initial usage,
you will have to consult the sources for fine-tuning the parameters.

To build better optimized binary, type:

	make zzgo-profiled

This will also create binary zzgo, but while the build will take
more time (probably less than a minute anyway), the resulting binary
will be about 1/4 to 1/5 faster.
