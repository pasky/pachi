Pachi can refer to: a simple modular framework for programs playing
the game of Go/Weiqi/Baduk, and a reasonably strong engine built
within this framework.


Installation
------------

To build Pachi, simply type:

	make

The resulting binary program `pachi` is a GTP client; connect to it
with your favorite Go program interface (e.g. gogui or qgo), or use
kgsGtp to connect it to KGS.  (DO NOT make the GTP interface accessible
directly to untrusted users since the parser is not secure - see the
HACKING file for details.)

The pachi program can take many parameters, as well as the particular
engine being used; the defaults should be fine for initial usage,
see below for some more tips.

In case you hit compilation issues (e.g. when building on MacOS/X)
or want to change the build configuration, check the user configurable
section at the top of the Makefile.


Engine
------

The default engine plays by Chinese rules and should be about 7d KGS
strength on 9x9. On 19x19 (using e.g. six-way Intel i7), it can hold
a solid KGS 2d rank.  When using a large cluster (64 machines,
20 cores each), it maintains KGS 3d to 4d and has won e.g. a 7-stone
handicap game against Zhou Junxun 9p.

By default, Pachi currently uses the UCT engine that combines
Monte Carlo approach with tree search; UCB1AMAF tree policy using
the RAVE method is used for tree search, while the Moggy playout
policy using 3x3 patterns and various tactical checks is used for
the semi-random Monte Carlo playouts.  Large-scale board patterns
are used in the tree search.

At the same time, we keep trying a wide variety of other approaches
and enhancements. Pachi is an active research platform and quite a few
improvements have been already achieved. We rigorously play-test new
features and enable them by default only when they give a universal
strength boost.

How to run
~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Pachi will run on a single CPU core, taking up to 1.4GiB
of memory and taking a little under 15 seconds per move.  You can
adjust these parameters by passing it extra command line options:

	./pachi -t _1200 threads=8,max_tree_size=3072

This will make Pachi play with time settings 20:00 S.D. with 8 threads,
taking up to 3GiB of memory (+ several tens MiB as a constant overhead)
and thinking during the opponent's turn as well.

Pachi can use an opening book in a Fuego-compatible format - you can
obtain one at http://gnugo.baduk.org/fuegoob.htm and use it in Pachi
with the -f parameter:

	./pachi -f book.dat ...

You may wish to append some custom Pachi opening book lines to book.dat;
take them from the book.dat.extra file. If using the default Fuego book,
you may want to remove the lines listed in book.dat.bad.

Pachi can also use a pattern database to improve its playing performance.
You can get it at http://pachi.or.cz/pat/ - you will also find further
instructions there.

For now, there is no comprehensive documentation of options, but you
can get a pretty good idea by looking at the uct_state_init() function
in uct/uct.c - you will find the list of UCT engine options there, each
with a description. At any rate, usually the three options above are
the only ones you really want to tweak.

DCNN support
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pachi can use a neural network as source of good moves to consider.
Currently this makes it about 1 stone stronger and tends to make the games
more pretty.

First, build Pachi with DCNN support:
- Install Caffe library (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org)
  CPU only build is fine, no need for GPU, cuda or the other optional
  dependencies.
- Edit Makefile, set DCNN=1, point it to where caffe is installed and build.

Install dcnn files in current directory where pachi will run.
Detlef Schmicker's 54% dcnn can be found at:  
  http://physik.de/CNNlast.tar.gz

More information about this dcnn can be found at:
  http://computer-go.org/pipermail/computer-go/2015-December/008324.html

If you want to use a network with different inputs you'll have to tweak
dcnn.cpp to accomodate it. Pachi will check for "golast19.prototxt" and
"golast.trained" files on startup and use them if present when
playing on 19x19. For now dcnn and pondering can't be used together
(pondering data is thrown away).


Greedy Pachi
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally, Pachi cares only for win or loss and does not take into
account the point amount. This means that it will play slack endgame
when winning and crazy moves followed with a resign when losing.

It may give you a more pleasurable playing experience if Pachi
_does_ take into account the point size, strives for a maximum
(reasonable) win margin when winning and minimal point loss when
losing. This is possible by using the maximize_score parameter, e.g.:

	./pachi -t _1200 threads=8,maximize_score

This enables an aggressive dynamic komi usage and end result margin
is included in node values aside of winrate. Pachi will also enter
scoring even when losing (normally, Pachi will never pass in that case).
Note that if you pass any 'dynkomi' parameter to Pachi, you will reset
the values set by 'maximize_score'.

Note that Pachi in this mode may be slightly weaker, and result margin
should not be taken into account when judging either player's strength.
During the game, the winning/losing margin can be approximated from
Pachi's "extra komi" or "xkomi" reporting in the progress messages.

Experiments and Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Except UCT, Pachi supports a simple idiotbot-like engine and an example
treeless MonteCarlo-player. The MonteCarlo simulation ("playout")
policies are also pluggable, by default we use the one that makes use of
heavy domain knowledge.

Other special engines are also provided:
* a "distributed" engine for cluster play; the description at the top of
  distributed/distributed.c should provide all the guidance
* a simple "replay" engine that will simply play moves according
  to the playout policy suggestions
* a simple "patternplay" engine that will play moves according to the
  learned patterns
* few other purely for development usage

Pachi can be used as a test opponent for development of other go-playing
programs. For example, to get the "plainest UCT" player, use:

	./pachi -t =5000 policy=ucb1,playout=light,prior=eqex=0,dynkomi=none,pondering=0,pass_all_alive

This will fix the number of playouts per move to 5000, switch the node
selection policy from ucb1amaf to ucb1 (i.e. disable RAVE), switch the
playouts from heuristic-heavy moggy to uniformly random light, stop
prioring the node values heuristically, turn off dynamic komi, disable
thinking on the opponent's time and make sure Pachi passes only when
just 10% alive stones remain on the board (to avoid disputes during
counting).

You can of course selectively re-enable various features or tweak this
further. But please note that using Pachi in this mode is not tested
extensively, so check its performance in whatever version you test
before you use it as a reference.

Note that even in this "basic UCT" mode, Pachi optimizes tree search
by considering board symmetries at the beginning. Currently, there's no
easy option to turn that off. The easiest way is to tweak board.c so
that board_symmetry_update() has goto break_symmetry at the beginning
and board_clear has board->symmetry.type = SYM_NONE.


Analysis
--------

Pachi can also help you analyze your games by being able to provide
its opinion on various positions. The user interface is very rudimentary,
but the ability is certainly there.

There are currently several Pachi interfaces provided for this purpose.

Winrate Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pachi can evaluate all moves within a given game and show how
the winrates for both players evolved - i.e. who was winning at which
game stage. This is implemented using the `tools/sgf-analyse.pl` script.
See the comment on top of the script about its usage.

Move Ranking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pachi can evaluate all available moves in a given situation
and for each give a value between 0 and 1 representing perceived
likelihood of winning the game if one would play that move. I.e. it can
suggest which moves would be good and bad in a single given situation.

To achieve the latter, note the number of move at the situation you
want to evaluate and run the `tools/sgf-ratemove.sh` script.
See the comment on top of the script about its usage.

Pattern Move Hinting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pachi can show instantenous pattern-based move suggestions very much
like for example Moyo Go Studio (though of course without a GUI).
You can use the Move Ranking method above (tools/sgf-ratemove.sh),
but pass it an extra parameter '-e patternplay'.


Framework
---------

The aim of the software framework is to make it easy to plug your
engine to the common infrastructure and implement your ideas while
minimalizing the overhead of implementing the GTP, speed-optimized
board implementation, etc.  Also, there are premade random playout
and UCT tree engines, so that you can directly tweak only particular
policies.  The infrastructure is pretty fast and it should be quite
easy for you (or us) to extend it to provide more facilities for
your engine.

See the HACKING file for a more detailed developer's view of Pachi.

Also, if you are interested about Pachi's architecture, algorithms
etc., consider taking a look at Petr Baudis' Master's Thesis:

	http://pasky.or.cz/go/prace.pdf

...or a slightly newer scientific paper on Pachi:
