Pachi stands on the research shoulders of giants:

Move Evaluation in Go using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
	Chris J. Maddison, Aja Huang, Ilya Sutskever & David Silver

Computing Elo Ratings of Move Patterns in the Game of Go
	Rémi Coulom

Modification of UCT with Patterns in Monte-Carlo Go
	Sylvain Gelly, Yizao Wang, Remi Munos & Olivier Teytaud

Combining Online and Offline Knowledge in UCT
	Sylvain Gelly, David Silver

And many others...



The 54% dcnn was trained by Detlef Schmicker and graciously shared
with the computer-go community.



Neural networks don't shine without good frameworks around them.
Kudos to all the good work that went into Caffe, Cuda and OpenBlas,
providing such a fast and flexible implementation. Even my old
laptop can go through the millions of multiplications needed to
evaluate the dcnn in less than a second, which is amazing.



Pachi contains unpublished methods we claim we have invented
independently:

* The dynamic komi feature.
* The local tree feature.



These people have made significant contributions to the code:

Petr Baudis
	Pachi the Bot ;-)

Jean-loup Gaily
	Distributed engine
	Time allocation algorithm
	Efficient UCT memory allocator

Lemonsqueeze
	Seki, dcnn and all kinds of things to Pachi's guts which
	unexpectedly ended up making it fly on embedded devices.


Pachi uses data extracted from the Kogo joseki dictionary as its
