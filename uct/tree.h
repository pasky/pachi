/* Management of UCT trees. See diagram below for the node structure.
 *
 * Two allocation methods are supported for the tree nodes:
 *
 * - calloc/free: each node is allocated with one calloc.
 *   After a move, all nodes except the subtree rooted at
 *   the played move are freed one by one with free().
 *   Since this can be very slow (seen 9s and loss on time because
 *   of this) the nodes are freed in a background thread.
 *   We still reserve enough memory for the next move in case
 *   the background thread doesn't free nodes fast enough.
 *
 * - fast_alloc: a large buffer is allocated once, and each
 *   node allocation takes some of this buffer. After a move
 *   is played, no memory if freed if the buffer still has
 *   enough free space. Otherwise the subtree rooted at the
 *   played move is copied to a temporary buffer, pruning it
 *   if necessary to fit in this small buffer. We copy by
 *   preference nodes with largest number of playouts.
 *   Then the temporary buffer is copied back to the original
 *   buffer, which has now plenty of space.
 *   Once the fast_alloc mode is proven reliable, the
 *   calloc/free method will be removed. */
