 * - fast_alloc: a large buffer is allocated once, and each
 *   node allocation takes some of this buffer. After a move
 *   is played, no memory if freed if the buffer still has
 *   enough free space. Otherwise the subtree rooted at the
 *   played move is copied to a temporary buffer, pruning it
 *   if necessary to fit in this small buffer. We copy by
 *   preference nodes with largest number of playouts.
 *   Then the temporary buffer is copied back to the original
 *   buffer, which has now plenty of space. */
