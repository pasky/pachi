/* When someone says "pattern", you imagine a configuration of stones in given
 * area (e.g. as matched very efficiently by pattern3 in case of 3x3 area).
 * However, we use a richer definition of pattern, where this is merely one
 * pattern _feature_. Another features may be is-a-selfatari, is-a-capture,
 * number of liberties, distance from last move, etc.
 *
 * Each feature is represented by its id and an optional 32-bit payload;
 * when matching, discrete (id,payload) pairs are considered.
 *
 * This is heavily influenced by (Coulom, 2007), of course. In addition,
 * the work of van der Werf, de Groot, Stern et al. and possibly others
 * inspired this pattern matcher.
 *
 * See the HACKING file for another description of the pattern matcher and
 * instructions on how to harvest and inspect patterns. */
