This file contains joseki fixes which are loaded at startup by Pachi.

It's used to generate josekifix.gtp which Pachi looks for in the directory where it
runs. To regenerate it after making changes type:
    $ cd josekifix ; make data 

To get latest version of this file, run:
    $ cd josekifix ; make update

Actual fixes are moves with an [override\] section at the top of the move comment,
something like:

  [override\]
  name = "3-3 blunder fix"
  around = D4

Moves without comments are just setup stones.
Except for last move, move order doesn't really matter.

Sequences normally take place in the lower-left corner to make it easy to navigate
/ search existing sequences, but for now play tengen to see how overrides work.]

3-4 joseki trick play:

If B doesn't have ladder around F4, W can punish:   
W can E3 as long as he doesn't play B4 (tricky !)
Ex: pachipachi OVO 2022-05-10

Interestingly 4-4 cross cut can revert to this (W stone at C8 in this case)
-> Match around D2 to match this also.
Ex: OVO SwissBot1 2022-10-26 08:29

Need to check 2nd ladder too:

[override\]
name = "tengen fight"
around = "last"


We just created an override :
Whenever opponent plays previous move (K10), Pachi will answer with current
move (J10) if board positions match (however rotated / color swapped)

Note:
        [override\] section must come at the very top (first line) for it to be recognized
        as an override, so it won't actually be used in this case.
        Right now there can be only one section per move.

Pass as current move is special : we don't provide an answer move.
In this case external joseki engine takes over following sequence in this area.

- Pattern area:

Since we specified 'around = "last"', matching is based on pattern around previous
move : circle area here (including the circled stones). Any stone outside this area
will not be taken into account for matching.

We could also have specified a location : around = K10
or 'around = H10' to match more stones to the left.

Best way to visualize pattern area is to bring Pachi up in GoGui and click :
    Tools -> Analyze Commands -> Josekifix Set Coord -> Run
Clicking different coordinates will display pattern area at that location.
This way you instantly see which stones are/are not included in the pattern.
]
;B[ii]TR[ji]C[Demo

This move is not an override.
We're dealing with only one side here (white), which is typically the case in other
variations. You can provide moves for both sides though if needed.
]
;W[ji]C[Demo

[override\]


Second override :
In this case we didn't specify 'name' or 'around' so it will reuse previous values.
(this doesn't work for the first override in a branch obviously).
This way if you have several overrides in a branch you only need to give values
for things that changed.

Next moves show what the circle pattern looks like at different locations in the 
corner, and how to pick a good location on an example.

Say you want to match this sequence, but you don't care if white's stone is
at D6 or C6.

In this case a pattern like the one at G2 would work nicely :
We capture enough of the area of interest and both D6 and C6 are outside.
So something like:

[override\]
name "hoshi shoulder hit"
around = G2
]
;W[]C[End of demo

There are a few extra things overrides can have like ladder checks and optional settings,
but this is probably enough to get started. You can always come back later if needed.



- Logged variations:

It's possible to just log a variation without interfering with game moves.
In this case create a [log\] section instead of an [override\] section.

They work just the same (matching etc) except answer move is ignored.
So it can be anything, but for sanity's sake it's always pass here.


- Ladder checks:

Overrides can also specify up to 2 ladder checks.
Syntax is more complicated because there are usually setup stones involved,
but otherwise you can write things like 'noladder_other = F2' or 'ladder_own = D4'
meaning "ladder at F2 doesn't work for opponent" and "ladder at D4 works for us".
See first variation in the tree ("3-4 trick play") for example.


- Optional settings:

  priority = n

Set override priority (default 0).
Can be useful to resolve cases where multiple overrides match but some are
more specific / desirable than others. Otherwise first match is kept and a warning
is issued.

  external_engine
  external_engine = lower_left lower_right

Turn external engine mode on in this quadrant (or quadrants).
This setting exists so you can enable more than one quadrant, or enable
external engine mode in normal overrides (which have an answer move).
In this case, useful to make sure external engine take over in case of
unknown deviation if variation is pretty critical.

  external_engine_diag

Same as external_engine but for diagonally opposite quadrant.

  external_engine_moves = n
  external_engine_moves = n1 n2 [...\]

Specify number of moves for external engine mode (default 15).
Can pass one number for each quadrant if more than one quadrant has
been enabled (in same order as external_engine setting).]))
