Description: engine for the game of go / weiqi / baduk
 Pachi is a reasonably strong engine for the ancient game of go
 (http://senseis.xmp.net/?Go)
 .
 The default engine plays by Chinese rules and should be about 7d KGS
 strength on 9x9. On 19x19 it can hold a solid KGS 2d rank on modest
 hardware (Raspberry Pi 3, dcnn) or faster machine (e.g. six-way Intel
 i7) without dcnn. When using a large cluster (64 machines, 20 cores each),
 it maintains KGS 3d to 4d and has won e.g. a 7-stone handicap game against
 Zhou Junxun 9p.
 .
 By default, Pachi currently uses the UCT engine that combines Monte Carlo
 approach with tree search; UCB1AMAF tree policy using the RAVE method is
 used for tree search, while the Moggy playout policy using 3×3 patterns
 and various tactical checks is used for the semi-random Monte Carlo
 playouts. Large-scale board patterns and dcnn are used in the tree
 search. Technical information (only slightly dated) about Pachi's
 architecture and algorithms can be found in Petr Baudis' Master's Thesis:
