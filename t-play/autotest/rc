# This is rc file for the autotest framework. It is interpreted as a shell
# snippet, so sh/bash evaluation rules apply.

# Here, we define some general execution environment configuration for
# autotest, the players that will get paired, and then actual pairings
# to perform. autotest clients will repeatedly pick a random pairing
# from the defined ones, play a game and record the result.

### General parameters:

# twogtp path - we need the gogui twogtp variant (the one that takes -black,
# not --black as parameter)
twogtp_path="/nfs/drahokam/pasky/gogui-1.1.10/bin/gogui-twogtp"
# If you want handicap support, you will need a custom patch from:
# http://pasky.or.cz/dev/pachi/gogui-handicap.diff


### Players:
# The player specification is later eval'd during the payring. You can use
# $1, $2, ... placeholders within the specification to substitute various
# parameters at the pairing time. The number parameter after player command
# specification specifies how many parameters the specification takes.

# Warning! If you change player definition, you WILL NOT be able to determine
# what definition your historical results used. Once you define a player of
# some id, it's bad idea to tweak the definition in any way.

# This is the reference player we use for our tests.
player gnugo10 'gnugo --mode gtp --chinese-rules --capture-all-dead --level 10' 0

# This is generic Pachi player that is being tested, we substitute particular
# revision and specific parameters in the pairings.
# ${2:+,$2} means that if second parameter is passed, it will be inserted here,
# comma-prepended, otherwise nothing will be inserted.
player zamafmoggy5k './pachi-$1 games=5000,pass_all_alive,policy=ucb1amaf,playout=moggy${2:+,$2}' 2


### Pairings:
# The pairing call looks somewhat elaborate:
#
# pairing BOARDSIZE KOMI BLACK PLAYER1 PLAYER1ARGS PLAYER2 PLAYER2ARGS
# BOARDSIZE: 9, 19, or whatever flavor you fancy...
# KOMI: 7.5, 0.5, ... OR h2, h6, ... (handicap amount, komi is forced to 0.5)
# BLACK: 'a' - black is chosen randomly, useful only if komi is 7.5
#	 '1' - black is PLAYER1,  '2' - black is PLAYER2
# PLAYER: Name of the player as defined above.
# PLAYERARGS: Parameters for the player, substituted for $1, $2, ...
#             Parameters must not contain whitespace.
#
# Win rates are always stored from PLAYER2 perspective, no matter
# what the player colors are - we assume that PLAYER1 is your reference
# player while PLAYER2 varies based on the particular configuration you
# want to test.

# You will be editing this all the time. :)
