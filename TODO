Strength:
* GPU mode
        Use dcnn for all nodes in the tree instead of just the root node.
        This should improve tree search quite a bit (1-2 stones stronger
        maybe). Try progressive widening, value networks.
* Tactics
        With low playouts Pachi sometimes makes simple tactical blunders
        which are costly (oiotoshi, cut and capture some stones ...)
        Fixing those would help quite a bit.
        -> better playouts / tree search ?
* Scalability
        On same machine cpu-only Hira (36I) scales better:
           6000 playouts -> 2d      15000 playouts -> 3d
        With 15000 playouts Pachi is 2d but increasing further doesn't
        help. Find what can be improved (it's not just playouts).
* Better playouts
        Moggy playouts are fast but noisy and not always balanced.
        There are some blind spots also. A good learnt, balanced policy
        would make quite a difference. See darkforest playouts for
        example (very slow though)
* MM / LFR large patterns (CPU mode)
        Use MM or LFR for priors instead of Stern-style patterns.
        Large patterns have 21% prediction rate right now, but drop
	to ~10% in middle game (see t-predict).
        Can expect 34% with MM and 44% with LFR throughout the game
        which should help tree search quite a bit. Implementation
        doesn't even need to be fast (incremental patterns) to be used
        in tree search. Try progressive widening.

Base:
* Further optimize board implementation, profiling fun
* Allow custom GTP commands for modules
* Improve gogui analyze commands:
    - Average playouts score estimate would be nice to have
      (already have ownermap score est)
    - Way to visualize winrates while playing ? graph would be nice
* Implement parameter setup over GTP (less important)
* Fix the build system to allow fully parallel build
	However, revamp to something like cmake (or, ugh, autotools)
	is not guaranteed to be appreciated.


Self-contained tasks:
* Improving Pachi's game analysis features
	We provide just a few user-unfriendly proof-of-concept scripts
	but it should be fairly easy to upgrade them to something
	that creates a nice webpage with move-by-move statistics,
	winrate evolution, pattern moves andwhatnot. CrazyStone stats
	output may be used for inspiration, but we can take it further!
	This could be done even if you are afraid of Pachi's codebase,
	just using Pachi's output.
* Try to disable the bsize pattern feature
	It just fudges the pattern evaluation since for most tactical
	patterns fourth line vs. fifth line just doesn't matter. Maybe
	its max should be 2 and maybe it should just be gone, needs
	regenerating the pattern database and benchmarking.
* Special sekis
        Playouts handle most sekis correctly now, but there are still
        some special cases it doesn't get right:
           - 2-stones corner seki / false-eye seki: see t-unit/moggy_seki.t
           - sekis which shouldn't be broken early, similar to
             breaking_3_stones_seki() but with more than 3 stones.
* Try to avoid using a hash table for 3x3 patterns
	Instead autogenerate procedural matching code; may be more
	efficient (the near-guaranteed L1 cache miss is fairly expensive).
        Experimented with this but no luck so far, with a few optimizations
        procedural code comes pretty close but still slower than hash table.
* Optimizing our tree implementation for cache-efficiency
	Statistics of all children of a parent node shall be contained
	in an array of the parent node so that move evaluation during
	the descent can access them sequentially in memory, instead
	of walking a linked list. Pasky already tried once but it's
	somewhat arduous and dull work.
* Clean up the is_private() hack in the distributed engine
	We should simply check against a proper IP range ACL specified
	as a parameter instead.

General improvements:
* Online Pachi game analysis/dump features
	Make Pachi generate a webpage with *lots* of details after each
	move while playing a game. This can provide game analysis info
	for observer or casual opponent, but could also help with
	debugging when just dumping stuff on stderr is intractable.
* Automated building of opening book
* Expanding and tagging the regression suite
	Even better, create a nice UI for our users to contribute and
	crowdsource!
	What about drawing testcases from GNUGo's regression suite?
* Implement Pachi support to fishtest
	http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests would allow crowdsourcing
	Pachi parameter tuning.
* Split playout aspects to custom-stackable pieces?
* Port to Intel Phi (if we get the hardware :)

Some heuristics to test:
* Try to adapt and reuse GNUGo's pattern matching code/database
* Local trees (work in progress, no luck so far)
* Liberty maps (work in progress)
* Implement a tsumego solver and apply it once per playout (stv insp.,
  see Eric van der Werf's PhD thesis?)
* Balanced local-based patterns?
* Killer moves (redundant to RAVE?)
* Reverse status learning
	Run on game corpus. Start at final position, watch development
	of status of all stones. The moment the final status and expected
	status changes, analyze, especially if move choice differs. Use
	learnt status-fixing moves in simulations somehow.
	Tried to do this on Pachi-played KGS games; no measurable effect
	(maybe too small sample).
